      campus in Thane and soon spread its wings to set up the second campus in Palava.

      giving back to the society by nurturing these young minds to shape the future of 
      our nation, the Lodha Group envisions the growth of the institution with multiple
      campuses in the city. All the institutions will collaboratively worktowards 
      achieving our desired outcomes of education.

      We desire every child stepping out of our institution to be:

      1. A Confident person who has a strong sense of right and wrong, is adaptable and
         resilient, knows himself, is discerning in judgement, thinks independently and
         critically and communicates effectively.

      2. A self-directed learner who takes responsibility of his own learning, who
         questions, reflects and perseveres in the pursuit of learning. 
      
      3. An Active contributor who is who is able to work effectively in teams, 
         exercises initiatives, takes calculated risks, is innovative and strives 
         for excellence.

      4. A concerned world citizen who has a strong civic consciousness, is informed
         and takes an active role in bettering the lives of others around him.
         
     We are confident that we will achieve our vision and contribute towards the 
     strengthening the future of our country.
